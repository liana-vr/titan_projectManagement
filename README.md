# titan_projectManagement

Titan is a project management tool designed to track and manage projects and team members. 
                        This web application allows users to view lists of all current projects and employees
                        as well as the status of the project and the amount of projects assigned to each employee. 
                        **Admin authentication** is required in order to create, update or delete new projects and employees.
                        Admin users are also able to assign employees to a project when it is created. Titan was built using **Java, Spring,
                        Tymeleaf, JavaScript, Html and CSS**. For data persistence I used a **PostgreSQL** database which is hosted on **AWS**.
